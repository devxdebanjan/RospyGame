## AIM
 Design multiplayer game architecture using ROS communication where each player 
has three components (monsters) and attacks each other through two modes 1 and 2. Here 
you will find three files **one for the server**, and **two for clients A and B** respectively.
## OS 
Linux (Distro: Ubuntu)
## LIBRARIES USED
- rospy from ROS Noetic 

## INSTRUCTIONS
- Run the roscore 
- **First run the server node.** 
- Next open clients A and B in any order you would like. Player A will get chance to input 
their moves first and then Player B. 
- This way the game will go on alternatively until winner 
is found. Most important precaution while running the game is that when using move 2 you 
should follow the exact format "2 opponent_monster_name". Here the opponentâ€™s name is case 
sensitive and the program will malfunction if you give any wrong inputs as error handling is yet to be done.
